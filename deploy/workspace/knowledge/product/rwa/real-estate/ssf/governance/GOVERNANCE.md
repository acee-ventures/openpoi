Prior written consent from the OR is **mandatory** for:

1. **Whitelist Changes**: Any change to the Owner's payout address.
2. **Economic Logic**: Changes to Issue Price, Floor Price, or Waterfall Priority.
3. **Rebate Pool Caps**: Any expenditure exceeding 40% of Treasury Allocation.

### X3. Information Access

- **Registry**: Weekly access to the Buyer Registry (Entity ID, Jurisdiction, Share count).

## 2. Addendum B: Enhanced Governance (Plan B — Conditional)

### B1. Conditional Trigger

Plan B (Enhanced Control) shall NOT take effect unless the Owner provides **Additional Consideration** to the Program:

- **Option 2: Commercial**: Granting exclusivity or asset pipeline expansion.
- **Option 3: Risk/Cost Support**: Funding critical program costs (Legal/Audit).

### B2. Enhanced Governance Seat

Upon trigger, the OR status is upgraded to one of the following:
